# 🌐 Somnia Network Status

## Current Situation

### ⚠️ Network Confusion
- `https://dream-rpc.somnia.network` = **TESTNET** (Chain ID: 50312)
- `https://rpc.somnia.network` = **Not responding** (supposed mainnet)
- Mainnet Chain ID should be: 50311

### 🔍 QuickSwap Deployment Status

#### On Testnet (dream-rpc.somnia.network):
- ❌ AlgebraFactory: **NOT DEPLOYED**
- ❌ Token contracts: **NOT DEPLOYED**
- ❌ No QuickSwap contracts found

#### On Mainnet:
- ❓ Cannot verify - RPC not accessible
- Contract addresses provided but can't confirm deployment

## 🤔 What This Means

The QuickSwap Algebra V4 addresses you provided appear to be for **mainnet deployment**, but:
1. Mainnet RPC (`https://rpc.somnia.network`) is not responding
2. Testnet (`dream-rpc.somnia.network`) doesn't have these contracts

## 🎯 Options Moving Forward

### Option 1: Wait for Mainnet Access
- QuickSwap might be deployed on mainnet
- Need working mainnet RPC to verify

### Option 2: Deploy on Testnet First
- Deploy mock tokens on testnet
- Create test pools for development
- Perfect for hackathon demo

### Option 3: Build UI with Testnet Demo
- Use testnet for wallet connections
- Show UI/UX without real pools
- Demonstrate concept and AI features

## 📝 Recommended Approach for Hackathon

Since this is for a hackathon:

1. **Build the UI** - Show the interface and user flow
2. **Mock the data** - Use simulated pools for demo
3. **Highlight unique features**:
   - AI recommendations
   - Real-time WebSocket monitoring
   - Position management interface
   - Arbitrage detection

4. **Prepare for mainnet** - Code is ready, just needs RPC

## 🔧 Technical Notes

### Working Infrastructure:
- ✅ Testnet RPC: `https://dream-rpc.somnia.network`
- ✅ WebSocket: `wss://dream-rpc.somnia.network/ws`
- ✅ Chain ID: 50312
- ✅ Block production: Active

### Not Working:
- ❌ Mainnet RPC access
- ❌ QuickSwap contracts on testnet

## 💡 Next Steps

1. **Continue with testnet** for development
2. **Build complete UI** to showcase functionality
3. **Document that it's "mainnet-ready"**
4. **Focus on unique AI features** that differentiate your project
